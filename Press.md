PJON has been released in the public domain through the Arduino forum and [www.gioblu.com](http://www.gioblu.com) in the far 2012. Only in 2015, thanks to the first publication of Michael Teew and then soon Hackernews, the PJON's repository started receiving a lot of traffic and new users. Since that day PJON has been reviewed by some of the most visited websites and blogs:
